The submission file IIITT.zip has the systems as follows:

- run 1 : Pre-trained Transformer Model (allenai/scibert_scivocab_uncased)
- run 2 : Average of probabities of predictions of ( BERT_base_uncased + RoBERTa_base + SciBERT)
- run 3 : Ensemble of probabilities of predictions by ranking the percentile of the result stored as a pandas DataFrame 
- The saved Models and predicted probabilities are available in this link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zY0dEyf49s0H00T7f_H575IKaJWHfWgO?usp=sharing
- The other performed models are available on https://github.com/adeepH/SDPRA-2021-SharedTask
